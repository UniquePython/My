# My
My is a micro language that I developed to understand the basics of lexing, parsing and interpreting. It is nothing fancy, and can only do simple arithmetic operations. It is a good starting point for learning about compilers and interpreters.

# Syntax
## Declaring variables
Declaring variables are very simple, as this language supports only numeric data types
```py
x = 5
```

## Arithmetic expressions
The variables can also be declared using arithmetic expressions.
```py
x = 1 + 5 / 3
```
*Remember:* '/' returns a floating point value and the spaces between operators and numbers is compulsory.

## Print statements
It is simple and intuitive
```py
print x
```
